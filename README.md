# scoplen-client

> The Scoplen desktop client for macOS and Windows: an SSH client that connects to hosts directly or through a self-hosted Scoplen bastion.

Scoplen is a Plystra project. The full Plystra philosophy applies; this repository's review record is [PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md](PROJECT_PRINCIPLES.md), which links to the project record in `scoplen-docs`.

Owner and operator: immoses (Moses Qiu). Responsible maintainer: immoses (Moses Qiu).

## Status

Maturity: Exploration. Maintenance: Active.

The application shell is in place: a Tauri 2 application for macOS and Windows, the Scoplen identity and design tokens, typed IPC generated from Rust with a binary channel transport, and a design system foundation with keyboard navigation, screen-reader labels, light and dark themes, increased-contrast and reduced-motion support, and ICU localization in English and Simplified Chinese. It keeps an encrypted local store: a SQLCipher database whose key is held in the macOS Keychain or, on Windows, by the TPM or DPAPI, optionally with a local passphrase. The application shows its about screen and lets you set the passphrase. It does not yet manage hosts, open connections, or sync; that work follows the client track of [`scoplen-docs/17-implementation-roadmap.md`](../scoplen-docs/17-implementation-roadmap.md), which is the only record of implementation status.

## What it does not do

- It sends nothing to the vendor: no telemetry, update server, or crash-report endpoint in Phase 1.
- It does not run on Linux, iOS, or Android in Phase 1.
- It does not contain the server, host agent, or web console; those are in `scoplen-server`.

## Repository shape

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `crates/scoplen-client-core` | Platform-independent client logic |
| `crates/scoplen-client-platform` | macOS and Windows integration; the only place `unsafe` code is allowed |
| `crates/scoplen-mosh` | Mosh client protocol (roadmap C12) |
| `src-tauri/` | Tauri 2 application shell and the typed command surface |
| `web/app/` | The client frontend (React, TypeScript) |
| `web/ui/` | `@scoplen/ui`, the design system: tokens, components, localization |

The terminal component package `@scoplen/terminal` is added in `web/terminal/` under roadmap C4. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the boundaries and [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for everyday work.

## Development

Requirements: read access to `plystra/scoplen-proto` (Cargo fetches it through the git CLI, so set `CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true`), the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (installed by rustup), Node.js 24.16.0 (`.nvmrc`), pnpm 11, and the Tauri prerequisites for your platform (Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS; Microsoft C++ Build Tools and WebView2 on Windows). Python 3 with Pillow and fontTools is needed only to regenerate the icon or the Chinese heading font.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Checks run before every change:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-targets
cargo deny check
cargo machete
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm license-check
```

On macOS, `scripts/check-offline.sh target/release/bundle/macos/Scoplen.app` verifies that a built application makes no network connection while sync is disabled.

To see every screen and state with sample data, run `pnpm --dir web/app dev` and open `/gallery.html`; see [docs/interface.md](docs/interface.md).

To build the application and confirm that it launches:

```bash
pnpm tauri build --bundles app
SPL_SMOKE_TEST=1 target/release/bundle/macos/Scoplen.app/Contents/MacOS/scoplen
```

## Data and privacy

Everything Scoplen keeps is stored on the device, in the application data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/com.scoplen.client` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\com.scoplen.client` on Windows). The store is a SQLCipher database encrypted with a random 256-bit key. That key is held in the macOS Keychain (only on this device, after the first unlock) or, on Windows, wrapped by a TPM-held key or by DPAPI for the current user. With a local passphrase, the key is additionally wrapped with a key derived from the passphrase by Argon2id; forgetting the passphrase makes the data unrecoverable. If the key is lost, Scoplen keeps the unreadable store under a new name and can start with empty data. The current build makes no network connections.
