# Changelog

All notable changes to the Scoplen desktop client are recorded here.

## Unreleased

- Added the application shell: a Tauri 2 application for macOS and Windows with the Scoplen icon, a typed IPC surface generated from Rust, a binary frame channel for streams, and a launch smoke test.
- Added `@scoplen/ui`: the Scoplen design tokens in light and dark with increased-contrast and reduced-motion support, bundled Inter, Lora, JetBrains Mono, and a Chinese heading subset of Noto Serif SC, the mark and lockup, buttons, a keyboard-navigable toolbar, a skip link, and ICU localization.
- Added the about screen in English and Simplified Chinese, with the interface language chosen from the system's preferences.
- Added the encrypted local store: SQLCipher with versioned migrations, a device identity and clock, field-by-field merging of local writes, change notifications, and the per-vault object limit.
- Added protection of the local database key in the macOS Keychain and, on Windows, the TPM or DPAPI, with an optional local passphrase, a passphrase-only mode for systems without a keystore, and recovery by starting with empty data when the key is lost.
- Added typed repositories for every object type, with field-level changes, clearing of optional fields, redacted credential secrets, and a `storeChanged` event to the interface after every committed change.
- Added device-local records: this device's credential secrets and keystore handles, the device key pair, a bounded session history, scrollback, and window geometry, which the main window now uses to reopen where it was.
- Added a macOS check that the application makes no network connection while sync is disabled.
- Fixed Windows test executables failing to start because they lacked the Common Controls manifest.
