# Terminal package architecture

## Purpose

`@scoplen/terminal` is a reusable view and interaction boundary. It is
session-agnostic: the package accepts bytes from a caller-owned source and
returns input bytes to caller-owned sinks. It never opens sockets, reads client
state, stores credentials, or performs cryptography.

## Data flow

```text
caller source (Uint8Array)
        │
        ▼
ScoplenTerminalElement ── xterm.js core + SearchAddon ── DOM renderer
        │                         │
        │                         └─ bounded xterm scrollback/profile
        │
        ├─ terminal-output event (copied bytes)
        ├─ primary sink (serialized writes)
        └─ optional broadcast sink (secondary, failure-isolated writes)
```

The element also keeps a byte-level output cap for observability and fallback
rendering. xterm.js owns terminal parsing, ANSI state, cursor, selection, and
scrollback rows. The byte cap is independent of the xterm row cap so a caller
can bound transport memory even when a profile keeps a larger scrollback.

## Lifecycle

1. `connectedCallback` creates xterm.js, loads the search addon, installs input
   and IME listeners, and subscribes to the source.
2. Source chunks are copied, emitted as `terminal-output`, retained under the
   byte cap, and written to xterm.js.
3. xterm `onData` and `onBinary` input is converted to `Uint8Array` and enters
   the same bounded, serialized sink path as `send()`.
4. `disconnectedCallback` aborts and unsubscribes the source, disposes xterm.js,
   and advances a generation counter. Queued writes observe that generation and
   fail with `TerminalDisconnectedError` before touching a sink.
5. Reconnecting creates a fresh renderer and replays the bounded byte history;
   the package does not claim durable session serialization.

If xterm.js cannot initialize, the element switches to a `pre` text fallback,
emits a `renderer` error, and keeps the same binary source/sink and accessibility
surface. This fallback is for host capability failures; it is not a terminal
emulator and does not claim full-screen program compatibility.

## Interaction boundaries

- **Profiles:** `TerminalProfile` is the small stable subset of xterm options
  that affects user-visible terminal appearance and scrollback.
- **Search:** `SearchAddon` searches xterm's retained rows. The byte preview is
  used only as a capability fallback.
- **Clipboard:** read/write operations are injected or use `navigator.clipboard`.
  Permission errors return `false` and emit a typed `clipboard` error.
- **IME:** composition events outside xterm.js' helper textarea pass through a
  DOM-free `TerminalImeCompositionBridge`. Candidate updates are discarded;
  only non-empty `compositionend` data reaches the sink. Cancellation, blur,
  and disconnection clear the pending composition.
- **Broadcast:** enabling requires an explicit confirmation callback. A
  secondary caller-owned sink receives copies of primary input and cannot make
  the primary write fail. The visible status indicator and events make the mode
  legible to keyboard and screen-reader users.
- **Tabs and splits:** `TerminalWorkspace` stores only layout metadata. It does
  not create, close, or reconnect sessions; callers bind terminal elements and
  transports to pane IDs.

## Capability boundaries

This slice intentionally leaves WebGL, Unicode 15 width handling, scrollback
serialization, inline image protocols, cross-platform IME verification, and the
`vttest`/`esctest` compatibility suite for later C4 outcomes. The package does
not describe those capabilities as available through a hidden fallback.
