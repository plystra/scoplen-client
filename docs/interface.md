# Interface and the core

The interface (`web/app`, `web/ui`) and the core (`crates/`, `src-tauri`) are built separately. Each screen states what it needs from the core as a TypeScript contract; the core implements that contract with typed commands. This page lists the contracts, what each operation must do, and how a contract is connected once its commands exist.

The screens never read the store, decide business rules, or hold secrets. Anything the screens must not decide — validation beyond "is this field empty", what a deletion removes, which areas the user has reached — is the core's.

## Seeing the screens

`pnpm --dir web/app dev`, then open `/gallery.html`. The gallery renders every screen and state with sample data (`web/app/src/gallery/sample-inventory.ts`), in English or Chinese, as on macOS or Windows. It is a development tool: it is not built into the application, and its sample data is not a reference implementation of the core.

## Window

`web/app/src/frame.tsx`. A strip of tabs above the content. The first tab is always Hosts; each session adds a tab after it (roadmap C5). On macOS the strip is the title bar: the window is created with `titleBarStyle: "Overlay"` and a hidden title, the strip leaves 84 px for the window controls, and its empty space carries `data-tauri-drag-region`. Windows keeps its native title bar. Settings opens from the gear at the right of the strip.

## Inventory (roadmap C3)

Contract: `web/app/src/inventory/api.ts` (`InventoryApi`). Screens: `inventory/home.tsx` (sidebar, list, details), `inventory/host-details.tsx`, `inventory/add-host.tsx`.

| Operation | What the core does |
| --- | --- |
| `areas()` | Which sidebar sources exist (`01-product-definition.md` §7.6): `favorites` when any host is a favorite, `recent` when the session history names a host, `groups` when any group exists, `keys` when a credential has been promoted by reuse or inspection, and `routes` when a route exists. Implicit tier-0 credentials do not make Keys visible. |
| `groups()` | Every group with its parent and host count. |
| `hosts(source, query)` | Hosts from the source (all, favorites, recent, or one group and its subgroups) whose name, address, username, or `key:value` tag contains the query, case-insensitive; favorites first, then by name. Orphaned hosts are not listed. `username`, `loginCount`, and `route` describe the default login, else the only one. |
| `recentSessions()` | The newest device-local session history entries, with the current Host label and login metadata. Entries whose Host or Login was deleted are omitted; no credential, scrollback, or live connection data is returned. Timestamps are decimal Unix-millisecond strings at the IPC boundary. |
| `host(id)` | The host with every login, `null` when it no longer exists. Inspecting a host promotes its implicit login; inspecting a private-key login also promotes that key credential. Password and agent credentials remain implicit. A key credential carries its public key. |
| `addHost(host)` | Creates the host, one implicit login, and an implicit credential, with a direct route, as one change (§7.6 tier 0). `name` defaults to the address and `port` to 22. Password and pasted or generated keys are stored as shared-binding credentials; a key file is read and stored the same way; `agent` creates an agent credential. Reusing an existing private key on a second host reuses and promotes that credential in the same transaction; the reuse search is bounded at 4,096 private-key credentials and returns a clear error beyond that limit. Each `AddHostError` names the field it belongs to; nothing is saved on error. |
| `setFavorite(id, favorite)` | Sets the favorite field. |
| `deleteHost(id)` | Deletes the host, its logins, and unnamed credentials no other login uses, and returns a token. |
| `undoDelete(token)` | Restores everything that deletion removed, for as long as the store keeps the tombstones. |
| `chooseKeyFile()` | Opens the system file picker starting in `~/.ssh`, returns the path or `null`. |
| `chooseOpenSshConfig()` | Opens a native picker for an OpenSSH config file, starting in `~/.ssh`; returns the path or `null` when canceled. The entry point is offered on the empty host list. |
| `previewOpenSshConfig(path)` | Reads at most 1 MiB of UTF-8 text and returns the selected path, importable literal hosts, skipped hosts with reasons, and every unsupported directive with its source line. It does not write to the store or source file. The review dialog lists the complete report and disables Import when no host is representable. |
| `importOpenSshConfig(preview)` | Available only while the host inventory is empty. Re-reads the source and rejects a changed preview, validates every host and identity file, then writes all importable hosts as one transaction. It returns imported hosts and the skip report; on an expected error, nothing is written. The source file is never modified. |
| `onChange(listener)` | Calls the listener after any inventory change; built on the `storeChanged` event (`ipc/store-events.ts`). |

The independent object editor uses the same `InventoryApi` boundary for the
objects that tier-0 creates implicitly:

| Operation | What the core does |
| --- | --- |
| `accessProfiles()` / `createAccessProfile()` / `updateAccessProfile()` / `deleteAccessProfile()` | Lists and edits AccessProfiles with host, Credential, and Route references validated before a write. Updating a default changes the Host default in the same store transaction; deleting the default or a profile used by a Forward is refused. |
| `credentials()` / `createCredential()` / `updateCredential()` / `deleteCredential()` | Lists and edits Credentials with kind and binding validation. Shared password and private-key material is accepted only on writes and is stored through the encrypted secret path; read DTOs expose only `hasSecret`. A credential referenced by a profile or proxy route cannot be deleted. |
| `routes()` / `createRoute()` / `updateRoute()` / `deleteRoute()` | Lists and edits reusable local Routes, validating jump profile and proxy credential references and endpoint shapes. Managed routes are display-only on the device, and routes referenced by a profile cannot be deleted. |

These operations return `ObjectEditError` on validation, reference, or
in-use failures. The error reference is diagnostic text and never contains
credential material. Independent object DTOs carry only redacted credential
labels and usage counts; secrets never cross the IPC boundary.

Every operation that can fail returns `Outcome`; a `Failure` carries a reference for support, free of secrets.

The tier-0 OpenSSH importer accepts simple literal `Host` blocks with `HostName`, `User`, `Port`, and `IdentityFile` values. It skips a host block when a directive or value in that block cannot be represented. Global settings, wildcard `Host` patterns, `Include`, and `Match` can affect other blocks, so the preview excludes every host in those files and explains why. Full OpenSSH semantics, `known_hosts`, keys discovery, and idempotent re-import belong to roadmap C10; this flow is limited to an empty inventory.

## Connecting a contract

1. Add the commands in `src-tauri` with `#[specta::specta]` and run `pnpm bindings`.
2. Write `web/app/src/inventory/core-api.ts`: an `InventoryApi` that calls the generated `commands`, mapping their results to the contract's types where they differ.
3. In `web/app/src/app.tsx`, once the local data is open, render `Frame` with `HostsHome` inside an `InventoryContext.Provider` holding that API. The about text moves into Settings.
4. The screen tests (`web/app/test/hosts.test.tsx`) run against the gallery's sample inventory and describe the expected behavior; add tests for the adapter itself.

A contract change is made in `api.ts`, its screens, and this page together.
